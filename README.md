### Project Description
A digital implementation of the Durak card game featuring:
- 2-player gameplay (Human vs AI)
- Graphical user interface
- Basic AI opponent
- Game statistics tracking

### Game Rules
Durak is a traditional Russian card game played with a 36-card deck. Each player is dealt 6 cards, and the bottom card is turned over to display the trump suit for that hand. The objective is to avoid being the last player with cards in hand.

### Project Requirements
- **Game Logic (2-player):** Implement game rules for 2 players (1 human vs 1 AI).
- **Basic Computer A.I.:** Implement AI logic for the computer-controlled player.
- **Graphical User Interface:** Simple, clean, and functional design with at least one custom control.
- **Object Oriented Concepts:** Implement complex code using OOP concepts (encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance).
